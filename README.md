# Description
This week, we were tasked to create an application called `Pizza-Hunt`. To create this application successfully, we must keep the following in mind:

- Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL.

- Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB.

- Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB.

- Integrate Mongoose in a full-stack web application.

- Create query builders to populate documents using refs.

- Implement client-side NoSQL using IndexedDB.



# Install
To install this application please `git clone` and then start up your server to view on localhost.
 
 
# Usage
`users can create their own pizza recipes`. They are also able to comment on other user pizza, as well as leave comments and threads.
